                <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
                <p>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It uses a system
                    of
                    elements and tags to organize content.
                    You can use headings (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), links (&lt;a&gt;), images
                    (&lt;img&gt;), and many other tags to build a webpage's structure.
                    Every element can also include attributes, such as <code>id</code> and <code>class</code>, which
                    help in
                    styling and scripting. Without HTML, no content would appear in your browser.

                <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe how HTML elements should look on screen. It
                    controls the
                    design, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more.
                    You can apply styles inline, inside a &lt;style&gt; tag in the HTML file, or using an external .css
                    file.
                    CSS allows for responsive design using media queries, flexbox, or grid systems.
                    It also supports animations and transitions to enhance user experience. Without CSS, websites would
                    be plain
                    and unattractive.

                <h3>JavaScript Interactivity</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a powerful programming language that allows developers to create interactive features
                    on
                    websites. It runs directly in the browser and responds to user actions.
                    You can use JavaScript to handle events like clicks and keyboard input, modify HTML content
                    dynamically,
                    validate forms, fetch data from APIs, and much more.
                    Modern JavaScript supports advanced features such as ES6 syntax, modules, and async/await for
                    smoother and
                    more efficient development. It brings your webpage to life.
